<h1>The Death Star and the Ultimate Vulnerability</h1>
<p>
The Death Star from Star Wars was an impressive though fictional feat of engineering, but it had a fatal flaw that was exploited by the rebels. Similarly, modern applications are at risk due to the many open-source dependencies used worldwide that can contain vulnerabilities. Some are just mistakes, and others, like that iconic exhaust port, were deliberately created. 
Managing these components and ensuring their security is crucial to prevent successful attacks. This session will take you to a galaxy far far away, to look at what went wrong in the Empire's supply chain to cause such a vulnerability to be introduced. By understanding the risks and using the right tools, we can avoid a catastrophe like the Death Starâ€™s destruction and put a stop to any rebel scum.
